Teenagers are young and eager, which means a lot of things (materialistic wise) begin to catch their eye. With this focused attention, teenagers will want a job so that they can buy the things that they seem fit but they might not be able to get a job due to lack of certain skills, etc.
The tech solution is to create a website that teenagers/young adults can use to find jobs/internships that does not need any type of skills or experience so that they can say that they know how to do certain things which will be able to help them to get jobs that they probably couldn't have gotten before.
